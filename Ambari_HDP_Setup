What are Ambari Blueprints ?
Ambari Blueprints are definition of your HDP cluster in “JSON” format, it contents information about all the hosts in your cluster, their components, mapping of stack components with each hosts or hostgroups and other cool stuff. Using Blueprints we can call Ambari APIs to completely automate HDP installation process.
